    <article id="article">

<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named 
Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late
 with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

<p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
     should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
      made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course 
      of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that 
exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

<p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
     uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
     ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

<p><q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew
     a double box around it.</p>

<p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had
     seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
     as inflation, looked right.</p>

<p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with 
    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
 wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a 
 trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

<p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including
     Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>

<p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>

<p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

    <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>

<p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
     according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>

<p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not 
part of the team, said, <q>This is huge, as big as it gets.</q></p>

<p>He continued, <q>This is a signal from the very earliest universe,sending a 
     telegram encoded in gravitational waves.</q></p>

<p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was
380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>

<p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
     here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

<p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

<p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such 
     a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
        
<p><q>With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.</q></p>
        
<p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of 
 observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
        
<p><q>It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,</q> 
    said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
        
<p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about
to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford 
colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of
Champagne to tell him the news.</p>

<p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had 
ordered anything.</p>

</p><q>And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that 
this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything,
 but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,</q>
  Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>

<p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still 
hyperventilating. <q>Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,</q> he said.</p>

<!-- --there more paragraphs on the orginal article-->

<p><q>The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,</q>
 Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. 
 <q>I’ve been hooked ever since,</q> he said.</p>

     <h3>Spirals in the Sky</h3>

<p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>

<h3>A Special Time</h3>

<p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, 
staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
